 * Animation time:
 * The duration of an animation is the time between the first and the last keyframe.

 *
 * For example a 10 second animation could have the following 4 keyframes:
 * [0,1,6,10]
 *
 * Interpolation between the keyframes is always linear in the corresponding interval.
 * Time '7' in the above example would interpolate frame 3 and frame 4 with alpha=0.25.
 * For doing this interpolation use getFrame(..)
